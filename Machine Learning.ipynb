    "<b>Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the square number of a root using Babylonian method, which sometimes is called Hero's method after the first-century Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria who gave the first explicit description of the method in his work Metrica [1,2]. The formula is  derived from (but predates) Newton–Raphson method and can be represented as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\ x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(x_n + \\frac{S}{x_n}\\right) \\\\\n",
    "\\text{ Where x is our initial guess of} \\sqrt {S}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Babylonian Method \n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative method is called the Babylonian method for finding square roots. It was known to the ancient Babylonians (1500 BC) and Greeks (100 AD) long before Newton invented his general procedure.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works. Suppose you are given any positive number $S$. To find the square root of $S$, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make an initial guess. Guess any positive number $x_{0}$.\n",
    "2. Improve the guess. Apply the formula \n",
    "$x_{1} = (x_{0} + S / x_{0}) / 2$. The average number $x_{1}$ calculated is a better approximation to sqrt($S$). \n",
    "3. Iterate until convergence. Apply the formula $x_{n+1} = (x_{n} + S / x_{n}) / 2$ until the process converges. Convergence is achieved when the digits of $x_{n+1}$ and $x_{n}$ agree to as many decimal places as you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple, starting from an arbitrary value of x, and y as 1, we can simply get next approximation of root by finding the average of x and y. Then the y value will be updated with  number / x [1,4].\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to take in consideration, the floating point result is not represented exactly in Python because computers operate in base 2 (binary) while natural floating point numbers are in base 10 (decimal) [5]. In the example below we can see an example on this."

    " ### About Chi-Square\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-square test for independence is also called Pearson’s chi-square test. Chi-square test for independence is used in science, economics, marketing, or other various fields. There are three ways to use the Chi-square. The Chi-square test for independence shows how two sets of data are independent of each other. Chi-square of the Goodness-of-fit test shows how different your data to the expected value. The test for homogeneity determines if two or more populations have the same distribution of a single categorical variable [8,9,10].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section below we will implement an example of Chi-square test for independence which compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. In a more general sense, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A very small chi square test statistic means that your observed data fits your expected data extremely well. In other words, there is a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A very large chi square test statistic means that the data does not fit very well. In other words, there isn’t a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the chi-square statistic used in the chi square test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\chi^2=\\Sigma\\frac{(O-E)^2}{E} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{where O is the actual value and E is the expected value.}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi-square statistic is one way to show a relationship between two categorical variables. In statistics, there are two types of variables: numerical (countable) variables and non-numerical (categorical) variables. The chi-squared statistic is a single number that tells you how much difference exists between your observed counts and the counts you would expect if there were no relationship at all in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "A low value for chi-square means there is a high correlation between your two sets of data. In theory, if your observed and expected values were equal (“no difference”) then chi-square would be zero — an event that is unlikely to happen in real life. Deciding whether a chi-square test statistic is large enough to indicate a statistically significant difference isn’t as easy it seems. It would be nice if we could say a chi-square test statistic >10 means a difference, but unfortunately that isn’t the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the difference you could use a p-value. First state the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. Then generate a chi-square curve for your results along with a p-value. Small p-values (under 5%) usually indicate that a difference is significant (or “small enough”).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using Chi Square P-Values</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi square test will give you a p-value. The p-value will tell you if your test results are significant or not. In order to perform a chi square test and get the p-value, you need two pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Degrees of freedom: You can find the degree of freedom in the third returned value when you use SciPy. The degree of freedom is used to find the p-value. The way you find the degree of freedom (dof) for 𝜒2 for independence is dof = (the number of rows - 1) X (The number of columns - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The alpha level(α). This is chosen by you, or the researcher. The usual alpha level is 0.05 (5%), but you could also have other levels like 0.01 or 0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below we demostrated that the Chi-square of the table above is approximately 24.6 and we can see the P-Value is 0.00041 which is lower than 0.01 which is one of the usual alpha level, therefore we reject the null hypothesis of independence and accept that the variables have a relation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the array at the end of the output is the contingency table (also called crosstab) with expected values based on all of our samples. Is used in statistics to summarise the relationship between several categorical variables and in our example we can see that blue collar and no collar have similar distribution and the white collar have higher values. \n",

    "\n",
    "When you have an entire population and calculate any parameter like the population standard deviation, your results will be accurate. That’s because you have all the data about your population. However, when you work with a sample, you’ve only got a small fraction of the population to work with. Therefore, your answers aren’t going to be as accurate as those you would have got, if you had the entire set of data to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, sample calculations with n in the denominator are almost always going to be higher than calculations with n-1 in the denominator. When you subtract 1 from your sample size, it happens to turn out you’re making a fairly good adjustment for the deflated sum of squares figure as long as n isn’t huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the case of the sample variance & standard deviation, the particular statistic you are working with is the sample mean (x̄) instead of the population mean (μ). Any x-value in your sample is going to be closer to x̄ than to μ.\n",
    "\n",

    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For small sample sizes, Bessel’s correction is going to be quite severe. If you have a small sample, it’s highly unlikely that it’s going to be a very good estimate of the population mean anyway. If you have a very large sample size, you’re going to approach a point when your sample statistics are going to be almost equal to your population parameters. In that case, Bessel’s correction simply isn’t needed at all.\n",

    "### Demonstration: \n",
    "\n",
    "When you calculate statistics for an entire population (mean, variance, etc.) results are accurate because all data is available. However, when you calculate statistics for a sample, results are estimates and therefore not as accurate [15].\n",

    "Per the results, we can see in line 2, 3 and 4 that on average, samples of a Normally-distributed population will produce a variance which is biased downward by a factor of n-1 on average. Therefore, by dividing the square-rooted variance by n-1, we make the denominator smaller, thereby making the result larger and leading to a so-called ‘unbiased’ estimate. As summary, we can see the population standard deviation is slightly lower than sample standard deviation as the sample are not as accurate as the total of population [17]. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can observe in the line 1 where the sample is equal to the total population. The larger your sample, the more of an opportunity you have to run into more population-representative points, i.e. points that are close to the mean. Therefore, you have less of a chance of getting a sample mean which results in differences which are too small, leading to a too-small variance, and you’re left with an undershot standard deviation. In that case, Bessel’s correction simply isn’t needed at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "In some cases, Bessel’s Correction does seem to be helping. It makes sense: very often the sample standard deviation will be lower than the population standard deviation, especially if the sample is small, because unrepresentative points (‘biased’ points, i.e. farther from the mean) will have more of an impact on the calculation of variance. Because the difference between each data point and the sample mean is being squared, the range of possible differences will be smaller than the real range if the population mean was used. Furthermore, taking a square root is a concave function, and therefore introduces ‘downward bias’ in estimations.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key point to emphasize here is that Bessel’s Correction, or dividing by n-1, doesn’t always actually help! Because the potential sample-variances are themselves t-distributed, you will unwittingly run into cases where n-1 will overshoot the real population standard deviation. It just so happens that n-1 is the best tool we have to correct for bias most of the time.\n"

    "Scikit is a open source tool for data mining and data analysis built in Numpy, Scipy and Matplotlib.\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is an unsupervised learning method that allows us to group set of objects based on similar characteristics and K-means is one of the most common clustering algorithm. \n",

    "## About K-means clustering to Fisher´s famous Iris Data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, clustering is the task of partitioning a dataset into groups. The objective of clustering is to identify distinct groups in the dataset such that the observations within a group are similar to each other but different from observations in other groups. Clustering is often used to find patterns in unlabeled data which has no label[21,22].\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means Algorithm is one of the simplest and most commonly used clustering algorithms. In k-means clustering, the algorithm attempts to group observations into k groups, with each group having roughly equal variance. The number of groups, k, is specified by the user as a hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, k-means clustering is implemented using the KMeans() class. When using this class, the user must specify the value of the hyperparameter k by setting the n_clusters parameter to an integer greater than 1 since the algorithm does not learn k by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of K-Means clustering is the K number of centroids representing the centre of each cluster and a number to each data point, indicating which cluster a particular data point belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How the K-Means Algorithm Works?</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "The k-means algorithm can be summarized in the following five steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Randomly pick K (predefined) number of centroids (cluster centres) from the data points as initial cluster centres.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. For each data point in the dataset, calculate the Euclidean distance between itself and each of the K centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Assign each data point to the closest cluster centre according to the distance measured in step 2. [After doing step 1, 2 and 3, the first iteration is completed and the points would be clustered.]\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now take the average of all of the points in each cluster and reposition the centroids using the newly calculated average.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Measure the distance between each of the old centroids and the new centroids.\n",
    "\n",
    "[If the distance is 0, that means that the centroids did not change their positions and hence the centroids are found. Otherwise, you repeat the steps 2, 3, 4 and 5 with the new centroids until all the centroids do not change position anymore (i.e. distance is 0).]\n",
    "\n",
    "The Euclidean distance between two data points (x and y) in an n-dimensional space is defined by the following formula. We use that distance to measure the similarity between data points in the K-Means Algorithm.\n",
    "\n",

    "Now let’s work on an example to see how k-means clustering works and how to implement it using Scikit-learn. For this example, we have a dataset named iris which is a built-in dataset in Scikit-learn. The dataset contains four columns — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measured in cm.\n",
