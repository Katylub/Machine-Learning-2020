    "<b>Write a Python function called sqrt2 that calculates and prints to the screen the square root of 2 to 100 decimal places. </b>\n",
    "\n",
    "We can calculate the square number of a root using Babylonian method, which sometimes is called Hero's method after the first-century Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria who gave the first explicit description of the method in his work Metrica [1,2]. The formula is  derived from (but predates) Newton–Raphson method and can be represented as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\ x_{n+1} = \\frac{1}{2} \\left(x_n + \\frac{S}{x_n}\\right) \\\\\n",
    "\\text{ Where x is our initial guess of} \\sqrt {S}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### About Babylonian Method \n",
    "\n",
    "The iterative method is called the Babylonian method for finding square roots. It was known to the ancient Babylonians (1500 BC) and Greeks (100 AD) long before Newton invented his general procedure.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works. Suppose you are given any positive number $S$. To find the square root of $S$, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make an initial guess. Guess any positive number $x_{0}$.\n",
    "2. Improve the guess. Apply the formula \n",
    "$x_{1} = (x_{0} + S / x_{0}) / 2$. The average number $x_{1}$ calculated is a better approximation to sqrt($S$). \n",
    "3. Iterate until convergence. Apply the formula $x_{n+1} = (x_{n} + S / x_{n}) / 2$ until the process converges. Convergence is achieved when the digits of $x_{n+1}$ and $x_{n}$ agree to as many decimal places as you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple, starting from an arbitrary value of x, and y as 1, we can simply get next approximation of root by finding the average of x and y. Then the y value will be updated with  number / x [1,4].\n",
    "\n",
    "We have to take in consideration, the floating point result is not represented exactly in Python because computers operate in base 2 (binary) while natural floating point numbers are in base 10 (decimal) [5]. In the example below we can see an example on this."

    " ### About Chi-Square\n",
    "\n",
    "The Chi-square test for independence is also called Pearson’s chi-square test. Chi-square test for independence is used in science, economics, marketing, or other various fields. There are three ways to use the Chi-square. The Chi-square test for independence shows how two sets of data are independent of each other. Chi-square of the Goodness-of-fit test shows how different your data to the expected value. The test for homogeneity determines if two or more populations have the same distribution of a single categorical variable [8,9,10].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section below we will implement an example of Chi-square test for independence which compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. In a more general sense, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A very small chi square test statistic means that your observed data fits your expected data extremely well. In other words, there is a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A very large chi square test statistic means that the data does not fit very well. In other words, there isn’t a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the chi-square statistic used in the chi square test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\chi^2=\\Sigma\\frac{(O-E)^2}{E} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{where O is the actual value and E is the expected value.}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi-square statistic is one way to show a relationship between two categorical variables. In statistics, there are two types of variables: numerical (countable) variables and non-numerical (categorical) variables. The chi-squared statistic is a single number that tells you how much difference exists between your observed counts and the counts you would expect if there were no relationship at all in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "A low value for chi-square means there is a high correlation between your two sets of data. In theory, if your observed and expected values were equal (“no difference”) then chi-square would be zero — an event that is unlikely to happen in real life. Deciding whether a chi-square test statistic is large enough to indicate a statistically significant difference isn’t as easy it seems. It would be nice if we could say a chi-square test statistic >10 means a difference, but unfortunately that isn’t the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the difference you could use a p-value. First state the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. Then generate a chi-square curve for your results along with a p-value. Small p-values (under 5%) usually indicate that a difference is significant (or “small enough”).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using Chi Square P-Values</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi square test will give you a p-value. The p-value will tell you if your test results are significant or not. In order to perform a chi square test and get the p-value, you need two pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Degrees of freedom: You can find the degree of freedom in the third returned value when you use SciPy. The degree of freedom is used to find the p-value. The way you find the degree of freedom (dof) for 𝜒2 for independence is dof = (the number of rows - 1) X (The number of columns - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The alpha level(α). This is chosen by you, or the researcher. The usual alpha level is 0.05 (5%), but you could also have other levels like 0.01 or 0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Demonstration\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below we demostrated that the Chi-square of the table above is approximately 24.6 and we can see the P-Value is 0.00041 which is lower than 0.01 which is one of the usual alpha level, therefore we reject the null hypothesis of independence and accept that the variables have a relation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the array at the end of the output is the contingency table (also called crosstab) with expected values based on all of our samples. Is used in statistics to summarise the relationship between several categorical variables and in our example we can see that blue collar and no collar have similar distribution and the white collar have higher values. \n",

    "\n",
    "In the case of the sample variance & standard deviation, the particular statistic you are working with is the sample mean (x̄) instead of the population mean (μ). Any x-value in your sample is going to be closer to x̄ than to μ.\n",

If you have a small sample, it’s highly unlikely that it’s going to be a very good estimate of the population mean anyway. If you have a very large sample size, you’re going to approach a point when your sample statistics are going to be almost equal to your population parameters.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Clustering is the task of partitioning a dataset into groups, called Clusters. The objective of clustering is to identify distinct groups in the dataset such that the observations within a group are similar to each other but different from observations in other groups. Clustering is often used to find patterns in unlabeled data which has no label.\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means Algorithm is one of the simplest and most commonly used clustering algorithms. In k-means clustering, the algorithm attempts to group observations into k groups, with each group having roughly equal variance. The number of groups, k, is specified by the user as a hyperparameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, k-means clustering is implemented using the KMeans() class. When using this class, the user must specify the value of the hyperparameter k by setting the n_clusters parameter to an integer greater than 1 since the algorithm does not learn k by itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "How the K-Means Algorithm Works\n",
    "The k-means algorithm can be summarized in the following five steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Pick a value for k (the number of clusters to create)\n",
    "2. Initialize k ‘centroids’ (starting points) in your data\n",
    "3. Create your clusters. Assign each point to the nearest centroid.\n",
    "4. Make your clusters better. Move each centroid to the center of its cluster.\n",
    "5. Repeat steps 3–4 until your centroids converge.\n",
    "\n",

    "Using Scikit-learn for K-Means Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let’s work on an example to see how k-means clustering works and how to implement it using Scikit-learn. For this example, we have a dataset named iris which is a built-in dataset in Scikit-learn. The dataset contains four columns — sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width measured in cm.\n",
