The formula is  derived from (but predates) Newton‚ÄìRaphson method and can be represented as below:\n",

    "The iterative method is called the Babylonian method for finding square roots. It was known to the ancient Babylonians (1500 BC) and Greeks (100 AD) long before Newton invented his general procedure.[3]\n",

    "Here's how it works. Suppose you are given any positive number $S$. To find the square root of S, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make an initial guess. Guess any positive number $x_{0}$.\n",
    "2. Improve the guess. Apply the formula \n",
    "$x_{1} = (x_{0} + S / x_{0}) / 2$. The number $x_{1}$ is a better approximation to sqrt($S$). \n",
    "3. Iterate until convergence. Apply the formula $x_{n+1} = (x_{n} + S / x_{n}) / 2$ until the process converges. Convergence is achieved when the digits of $x_{n+1}$ and $x_{n}$ agree to as many decimal places as you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple, starting from an arbitrary value of x, and y as 1, we can simply get next approximation of root by finding the average of x and y. Then the y value will be updated with  number / x [1,4]."

    "\n",
    "The Chi-square test for independence is also called Pearson‚Äôs chi-square test. Chi-square test for independence is used in science, economics, marketing, or other various fields. There are three ways to use the Chi-square. The Chi-square test for independence shows how two sets of data are independent of each other. Chi-square of the Goodness-of-fit test shows how different your data to the expected value. The test for homogeneity determines if two or more populations have the same distribution of a single categorical variable [8,9,10].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the section below we will implement an example of Chi-square test for independence which compares two variables in a contingency table to see if they are related. In a more general sense, it tests to see whether distributions of categorical variables differ from each another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A very small chi square test statistic means that your observed data fits your expected data extremely well. In other words, there is a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A very large chi square test statistic means that the data does not fit very well. In other words, there isn‚Äôt a relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "The formula for the chi-square statistic used in the chi square test is:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\chi^2=\\Sigma\\frac{(O-E)^2}{E} \\\\\n",
    "\\text{where O is the actual value and E is the expected value.}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi-square statistic is one way to show a relationship between two categorical variables. In statistics, there are two types of variables: numerical (countable) variables and non-numerical (categorical) variables. The chi-squared statistic is a single number that tells you how much difference exists between your observed counts and the counts you would expect if there were no relationship at all in the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "A low value for chi-square means there is a high correlation between your two sets of data. In theory, if your observed and expected values were equal (‚Äúno difference‚Äù) then chi-square would be zero ‚Äî an event that is unlikely to happen in real life. Deciding whether a chi-square test statistic is large enough to indicate a statistically significant difference isn‚Äôt as easy it seems. It would be nice if we could say a chi-square test statistic >10 means a difference, but unfortunately that isn‚Äôt the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate the difference you could use a p-value. First state the null hypothesis and the alternate hypothesis. Then generate a chi-square curve for your results along with a p-value. Small p-values (under 5%) usually indicate that a difference is significant (or ‚Äúsmall enough‚Äù).\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Using Chi Square P-Values</b>\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi square test will give you a p-value. The p-value will tell you if your test results are significant or not. In order to perform a chi square test and get the p-value, you need two pieces of information:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Degrees of freedom: You can find the degree of freedom in the third returned value when you use SciPy. The degree of freedom is used to find the p-value. The way you find the degree of freedom (dof) for ùúí2 for independence is dof = (the number of rows - 1) X (The number of columns - 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The alpha level(Œ±). This is chosen by you, or the researcher. The usual alpha level is 0.05 (5%), but you could also have other levels like 0.01 or 0.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example below we demostrated that the Chi-square of the table above is approximately 24.6 and we can see the P-Value is 0.00041 which is lower than 0.05, therefore we reject the null hypothesis of independence and accept that the variables have a relation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, the array at the end of the output is the contingency table (also called crosstab) with expected values based on all of our samples. Is used in statistics to summarise the relationship between several categorical variables and in our example we can see that blue collar and no collar have similar distribution and the white collar have a higher one. \n",

    "\n",
    "#### Difference between STDEV.P and STDEV.S\n",
    "\n",
    "The STDEV.P function is used when your data represents the entire population.The squared deviation is divided by the total number of arguments, represented in the formula above as N.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The STDEV.S function is used when your data is a sample of the entire population. The squared deviation is divided by the total number of sample -1. It is represented as N-1.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Since STDEV.P function considers entire data, and some factors may dominate the result standard deviation. And since it will be taken as the standard deviation for everyone in data, even for minorities, this is called <b>Biased Analysis</b>. This is why this standard deviation is recommended to use only when an analysis is non-destructive. Don‚Äôt use STDEV.P if you haven‚Äôt captured the entire population for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The STDEV.S or STDEV function is used on a small sample of the entire population, and we subtract one from the denominator (number of samples arguments). This is called <b>non-biassed analysis</b> of standard deviation. This is used when an analysis is destructive.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A low measure of Standard Deviation indicates that the data are less spread out, whereas a high value of Standard Deviation shows that the data in a set are spread apart from their mean average values. A useful property of the standard deviation is that, unlike the variance, it is expressed in the same units as the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the example below to demostrated the STDEV.S calculation is a better estimate for the standard deviation when performed on a sample. [14]\n",
    "\n",
    "For example taking a population with a total of 20 elements we will calculate the standard deviation using both STDEV.P and STDEV.S and using as sample 5 elements of the total as sample. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you calculate statistics for an entire population (mean, variance, etc.) results are accurate because all data is available. However, when you calculate statistics for a sample, results are estimates and therefore not as accurate [15].\n",
    "\n",
    "In the Example above we can see if we take a sample of population from the total the standard variation is lower using stdev.s formula with a deviation of 3.47 versus the stdev.p formula with a desviation of 3.61. This is due to Bessel¬¥s correction which is is an adjustment made to correct for bias that occurs when working with sample data. It appears in formulas as n-1, where n is the count. When working with a sample population, Bessel's correction can provide a better estimation of the standard deviation.\n",
