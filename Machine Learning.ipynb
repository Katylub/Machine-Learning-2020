    "We can calculate the square number of a root using Babylonian method, which sometimes is called Hero's method after the first-century Greek mathematician Hero of Alexandria who gave the first explicit description of the method in his work Metrica [2]. The formula is  derived from (but predates) Newton‚ÄìRaphson method and can be represented as below:\n",

    "\n",
    "The iterative method is called the Babylonian method for finding square roots. It was known to the ancient Babylonians (1500 BC) and Greeks (100 AD) long before Newton invented his general procedure.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's how it works. Suppose you are given any positive number $S$. To find the square root of S, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Make an initial guess. Guess any positive number $x_{0}$.\n",
    "2. Improve the guess. Apply the formula \n",
    "$x_{1} = (x_{0} + S / x_{0}) / 2$. The number $x_{1}$ is a better approximation to sqrt($S$). \n",
    "3. Iterate until convergence. Apply the formula $x_{n+1} = (x_{n} + S / x_{n}) / 2$ until the process converges. Convergence is achieved when the digits of $x_{n+1}$ and $x_{n}$ agree to as many decimal places as you desire.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is simple, starting from an arbitrary value of x, and y as 1, we can simply get next approximation of root by finding the average of x and y. Then the y value will be updated with  number / x [1,4]."

There are three ways to use the Chi-square. The Chi-square test for independence shows how two sets of data are independent of each other.

The test for homogeneity determines if two or more populations have the same distribution of a single categorical variable [8].\n",

    "Depending on the test, we are generally looking for a threshold at either 0.05 or 0.01. Our test is significant (i.e. we reject the null hypothesis) if we get a p-value below our threshold[8].\n",
